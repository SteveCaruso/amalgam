        <h1>Introduction: A Word Game</h1>

        <img src="/img/genesis.png">

        <p>Words have always had a special sort of strength in the beliefs of men. In the book of Genesis, the God of the Hebrews speaks the world into existence. In the Middle Ages, magicians used “magic words” to command their tricks to work, and in various folk religions knowing the name of a kami, spirit, or angel – a “word of power” – was believed to afford a certain amount of control over the supernatural.</p>

        <p>Even in modern times and in secular cultures, in civil proceedings one must “give their word” as a promise, or sign their name – their personal words of identification – onto a piece of paper as a legally binding token. According to the famous Saphir-Whorf Hypothesis, words shape thought, and in turn one’s thoughts shape the words they use. In this sense, words in Amalgam are no different, as it is words that shape your Character and how they shape the world around them.</p>

        <p>What will you need to play? A stack of index cards and a pen or other writing implement is sufficient. Another recommended tool that you may find useful in your experience with this game is a good dictionary, as mastery of words and their meanings can give you a great advantage.</p>

        <p>Amalgam was designed to be a generic roleplaying system which is well suited for all genres. Where many systems focus upon sets of statistics and numbers to represent more or less realistic simulations of chance, Amalgam focuses more heavily upon role-playing, and how the play of words guide the play of the game.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">And this is how...</p>

    </section>

    <section id="ch1" class="twoCol">

        <h1>Chapter 1: The Amalgamate</h1>

        <p>Everything in this world is made up of pieces. Even the word “pieces” is made up of letters. Each letter makes a sound, and each sound can be broken down into where you articulate it in your mouth. Your mouth is made of several organs, which are in turn made of cells, which are in turn made of molecules, which are in turn... well you get the idea.</p>

        <p>In Amalgam, Characters are made up of <span class="index">Words</span>. So in Amalgam, Characters are quick to conceive. No points, no “rolling up;” a Character is made up by how one would describe them, “in their own words.”</p>

        <p>Characters can be “Strong,” “Clever,” or “Mysterious” – they can have “Moxie,” or “Clarity” or even embody short phrase Words like “Crack Shot.” Appropriate Words are up to you and the Storyteller to explore.</p>

        <h2>A Character's Words</h2>

        <p>Now the <span class="index">Amalgamate</span>, besides being the title of this chapter, is the name of the overall “pool” of Words that a Character is made up of. To create a Character simply choose 10 different Words and write each down on an index card and lay them out in front of you. Each one of these Words must describe the Character in some way, and be inherent to who they are. For example, if we were creating a Thief, we may come up with something similar to what we see below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thief</strong> – Obviously our character is a thief.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong</strong> – He's done some weightlifting.</li>
            <li><strong>Wiry</strong> – He's not too bulky, but muscular.</li>
            <li><strong>Civil</strong> – Our boy here is no ruffian.</li>
            <li><strong>Agile</strong> – He's quick on his feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Focused</strong> – He's good at ignoring distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Limber</strong> – He's readily adaptable.</li>
            <li><strong>Swift</strong> – Quick in and quick out.</li>
            <li><strong>Guileful</strong> – He's tricky to let on.</li>
            <li><strong>Persuasive</strong> – And even if he does, he can convince you otherwise.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="/img/thief_cards.png" class="max5in">

        <h2>Snags</h2>

        <p>Every Character has quirks and things that make them interesting. <span class="index">Snags</span> are Words that embody these things that are generally not advantageous – flaws, or imperfections if you will – such as “Smoker,” “Untrusting,” “Agoraphobic,” etc.. A new Character can take up to 3 Snags, and for each Snag they take, they may add an additional Word into their Amalgamate. </p>
            
        <p>Snags are also, not easy to get rid of, and unless something truly paramount happens in a Character’s story, a Player should anticipate their Character’s Snags sticking with them throughout the game.</p>  
        
        <p>They are generally marked with an (S) to distinguish them from other Words.
        </p>

        <h2>Stacks</h2>

        <p>The Storyteller can also offer <span class="index">Stacks</span> depending on what the game needs. Stacks can be pretty much anything, from “races” to “character classes” to “archetypes” – plot or theme related combinations relevant to the particular game.  All a Stack consists of is a small list of Words and Snags that a Character can take “for free.” They don't count towards their Word limit, but they must be accepted as a unit. </p>

        <p>Generally, Words in a Stack are marked with a (T) (for “Template”) to distinguish them from other Words.</p>

        <img src="/img/tea_angel.png">

        <h2>Gaining Words</h2>

        <p>As a Character progresses in Amalgam, instead of gaining experience points or extra levels as they would in other systems, Characters gain more Words. Generally speaking a Storyteller will award one Word (of the Player’s choice) per excursion. In circumstances of exceptional play or relevance to the plot, the Storyteller can also award “Bonus Words” for Players.</p>

        <p>It is also good practice to allow a Player to choose appropriate Words for their Character. For example, a Character that did nothing but sit around and eat pizza for the entire adventure should not get away with a new “Athletic.”  Once again this is up to the good judgement of the Storyteller and input from all of the Players involved.</p>

        <h2>Word Levels</h2>

        <p>Working with additional words, however, can cause some difficulty keeping them all straight (especially when the list grows long). As a result, Words will automatically combine and <span class="index" xref="Words">Level</span> up.</p>

        <img src="/img/level_up_words.png" class="max5in">

        <p>When a Character posesses three of the same Word, they immediately combine to form a Level 2 Word, which counts as 2 Words towards resolving an Action. Three Level 2 Words become a Level 3 Word (which counts as 3 Words). Where this may seem like a disadvantage (as a Level 3 Word is essentially made up of nine Level 1 Words) don’t worry. The reason for this progression will become more obvious in the next Chapter.</p>

        <h2>Proficiencies</h2>

        <p>Once a Word reaches Level 3, a Player may immediately take a <span class="index" xref="Words">Proficiency</span> on it. A Proficiency is a “sub-word” that describes a particular specialty or niche use for that Word which allows them a special bonus under certain circumstances. </p>

        <p>For example, someone with a Runner L3 could take “Sprint” which would give a bonus  when speeding over short distances, but not over long hauls. </p>

        <p>Proficiencies can also represent particular maneuvers. For example, someone with Brawler L3 could take “Sucker Punch” which would bestow a bonus when their target isn’t expecting an attack.</p>

        <p>The general rule is that Proficiency is unique enough that Character may only make use of it in very specific circumstances. For example, it would be improper to take “Speedy” on Runner, as it is far too general and could be used practically at any time.</p>

        <p>Now, the specific type of bonus that a Character can take depends on several possible choices which are explained in detail in the chapter on Manipulating Words, but we need to cover a little more about the rules before they’ll make much sense. For now, simply keep this in mind.</p>

        <h2>Activity &amp; Autonomy</h2>

        <p>Now that we've decided a Character's Words, we need to better understand how they work within the dynamics of the game. Despite one’s achievements and proficiencies in life, one is never all that they are at every time of day. Even if you're usually sharp, the average person wakes up groggy in the morning. If you're tired, after you rest you feel invigorated again. It takes effort to be compassionate in the heat of  an argument, and it takes time to think through a problem when distracted. </p>

        <p>As such, out of all of a Character’s Words, they may only have 5 that are <span class="index" xref="Words">Active</span> at any give time. Those five Active Words represent and determine what your Character is ready for at that very moment. For example, our Thief friend may want to have the following Active when picking a lock:</p>

        <img src="/img/thief_active_picking_lock.png" class="max5in">

        <p>Or the following Active when they are sweet-talking their way out of a tricky situation:</p>

        <img src="/img/thief_active_tricky_talk.png" class="max5in">

        <p>As such, Active Words are the Words that your Character has actively “under control” at any given time. </p>

        <p>Words that are “<span class="index" xref="Words">Inactive</span>” or <span class="index" xref="Words">Autonomous</span> go about their merry way. This is how some Words may cause problems: Any Words that you do not have Active and under control, will act on their own accord. </p>

        <p>As a result, Words that are Autonomous generally will not give you any help in a tricky situation unless there is a reasonable exception, for it is the number of relevant Active Words in your Amalgamate that determines how a Character will faire with individual tasks.</p>

        <img src="/img/thief_active_snag.png" class="max5in">

        <p>There is an exception, however: <span class="index">Snags</span>, for all intents and purposes, are Words that are always Autonomous. As a result a Character may never have one of their Snags Active, nor gain an advantage from them under any circumstances. </p>

        <h2>Common Words for New Players</h2>

        <p>Most new Players tend to gravitate towards several classes of Words that make the Character creation process easier:</p>

        <h3>Archetype Words</h3>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Words">Archetypes</span> include things like a Character’s race, profession, class, special powers, or other broad concepts about them. It’s generally a good idea to start off with one or two Archetypes and then fill out the rest of the Character with Physical, Mental, and Social Words. </p>

        <h3>Physical Words</h3>

        <p>These <span class="index" xref="Words">Physical</span> Words represent a Character’s physical prowess, strength, and the ability to stay alive after taking damage.</p>

            <dt>Athletic</dt> 
            <dd>You don't tire out easily after physical exertion.</dd>

            <dd>You know your way around bladed weapons.</dd>
        </dl>


        <h3>Mental Words</h3>

        <p>These <span class="index" xref="Words">Mental</span> Words represent a Character’s mental abilities, how they think, how aware they are about details, and what domains of knowledge they have. (In fact, good additions to this list are Words in particular kinds of knowledge.)</p>

            <dt>Academic</dt>

        </dl>

        <h3>Social Words</h3>

        <p>These <span class="index" xref="Words">Social</span> Words have everything to do with how your Character interacts with other Characters and their greater place in society.</p>

    <section id="ch2" class="twoCol">

        <h1>Chapter 2: Resolving Actions</h1>

        <p>When confronted with a situation, or an <span class="index">Action</span> that a Character wishes to undertake, instead of rolling dice, we need but do three things: First, we need to figure out how apt they are to complete the Action. Second we must figure out how difficult the task is, and thirdly throw a bit of randomness in to see if they succeed.</p>

        <h2>The Pledge</h2>

        <p>As mentioned above, the first thing to figure out is how prepared or able your Character is to complete an Action. This is simply determined by adding up the number of Words in your Character’s Active Amalgamate that would be appropriate to the task.</p>

        <p>Where one may simply add them up and call out the number, Player may also address the Storyteller with a descriptive narrative detailing what they are planning to do and emphasizing which Words they plan to do it with. This is known as the <span class="index">Pledge</span>.</p>

        <p>For example, looking back at our Thief let’s assume that he’s trying to pick a lock with the following words:</p>

        <img src="/img/thief_active_picking_lock_2.png" class="max5in">

        <p>Looking over things carefully, the Thief’s Player addresses the Storyteller:</p>


        <blockquote>“<strong>Focusing</strong> carefully, I <strong>Swiftly</strong> pick the lock with my <strong>Agile</strong> fingers.”</blockquote>


        <p>This would give him a Pledge of 3. If (as another example) he becomes impatient with the task and gives up, he may choose to say:</p>


        <blockquote>“Getting frustrated, with a <strong>Wiry</strong> grip on the knob, I give the door a Strong blow with my shoulder.”</blockquote>


        <p>Which would give him a Pledge of 2 with great roleplaying effect.</p>

        <p>If the Storyteller believes that one or more of the Words the Player chose to be inappropriate or notices an Autonomous Word in the Character’s Amalgamate that may cause problems (such as a Snag) they may disqualify them, either outright, or respond by identifying them. This reduces the Character’s Pledge appropriately.</p>

        <p>For example, if a Character who was trying to hide behind some cover had the Snag “Large,” the Storyteller might say:</p>


        <blockquote>“As you crouch down behind the bush, your <strong>Large</strong> frame isn’t completely covered by the branches.”</blockquote>


        <p>This would reduce the Character’s Pledge by 1; however, the Player is now completely open to start another Pledge to defend their use of the Words in question. Pledges between Player and Storyteller may go back and forth until either the Player is satisfied with their final Pledge, or the Storyteller after several iterations wishes to call for resolution.</p>

        <h2>Difficulty</h2>

        <p>Next, depending on how hard the task at hand is, the Storyteller will choose an appropriate <span class="index" xref="Action">Difficulty</span>.  The average task Difficulty is 5. Easier tasks are less, harder or specialized tasks are more. Here is a suggested list of Difficulties which are a good way to feel out the average encounter. </p>

        <p>Depending on the situation, the Storyteller may opt to adjust the Difficulty on the fly, and at the Storyteller’s option, they may decide to keep the Difficulty a secret.</p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Example Difficulties:</figcaption>
            <dl>
                <dt>1:	Ridiculously easy tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Breathing. Remembering your name.)</dd>
            
                <dt>2-4:	Easy-to-Everyday tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Write legibly. Climb a rope ladder.)</dd>
                <dt>5: Average task difficulty</dt>
                <dd>(Use any standard, trained skill.)</dd>
                <dt>6-9:	Tough or Skilled tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Rig a wagon wheel to fall off.)</dd>
                <dt>10:	Hard tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Picking an average lock.)</dd>
                <dt>11-15:	Extremely hard tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Leap across a 30 foot cavern.)</dd>
            
                <dt>16-20D	Impossibly hard tasks</dt>
                <dd>(Hack into a government mainframe, blindfolded.)</dd>
            </dl>
        </figure>

        <h2>Throwing Random Numbers</h2>

        <p>Random numbers are, traditionally, represented by dice in roleplaying systems; however, dice can in some circumstances be a bit cumbersome or tend to get lost.</p>

        <p>To do so, the Player of the Character in question turns and faces the Storyteller (or another player if they wish) and engage in an alternate form of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Instead of throwing one of the three traditional gestures of the game on the fourth shake (“one, two, three – shoot!”) the two parties extend 1 to 5 fingers. The collection of pointing digits shown is added up. The rule is: If the total is over 5, subtract 5. The result is a rather random number between 1 and 5 (very useful for our purposes). This is known as a <span class="index">Random Throw</span>.</p>

        <img src="/img/face_off_chart.png" class="max5in">

        <h2>Success and Failure</h2>

        <p>To actually determine the <span class="index">Success</span> or <span class="index">Failure</span> of the Action, take a Random Throw, add the Character’s Pledge to it, and if the final value (known as the Character’s Performance) meets or exceeds the Difficulty, the Character succeeds. Otherwise the attempt is a failure and the Character is otherwise unable to complete their Action.</p>

        <h2>Degree of Success</h2>

        <p>When one Succeeds at an Action, the result may have to take the <span class="index" xref="Success">Degree of Success</span> into account. This determines exactly how well your Character has pulled the Action off. The value is simply determined by the highest Level Word used in the Action. For example, if someone’s highest Level Word was a Strength L3, their Degree of Success is 3. If someone’s highest Level Word was a Smart L1, their Degree of Success is 1.</p>

        <h2>Critical Throws & Failures</h2>

        <p>Of course, there always has to be a catch and that is exactly how <span class="index" xref="Success">Critical Throws</span> and <span class="index" xref="Failure">Critical Failures</span> work. In throwing a random number, if by some twist of fate doubles show up (both parties throw the same number of fingers as indicated by “X” on the Throwing Random Numbers chart), a flash round of odds and evens is played. </p>

        <img src="/img/crit_table.png" style="width:50%">

        <p>If you throw evens, you have scored a Critical Throw. Your Performance becomes your Pledge + 10 and if you Succeed, your Degree of Success is doubled.</p>

        <p>If you throw odds, you have scored a Critical Failure. Both your total Performance and Degree of Success are reduced to 0.</p>

        <h2>Using Dice</h2>

        <p>Sometimes Players prefer the feel of dice in their hands rather than flicking fingers. This can be accomplished using standard 6-sided <span class="index">Dice</span>. When resolving actions, add up your appropriate Words as usual, but instead of throwing fingers, roll a 6-sided die. </p>

        <p>On a 1-5, it resolves as a usual Throw; however, a roll of 6 prompts a Critical Throw Check. In that case, the Player rolls again. On an even number (2, 4, 6) the roll is a Critical Throw, where on an odd number (1, 3, 5) the roll is a Critical Failure. From there, play resumes normally.</p>

        <h2>Proficiencies</h2>

        <p>Back in the previous chapter we discussed Proficiencies, “sub-words” that describe a particular specialty or niche use for that Word which allows them a special bonus under certain circumstances. </p>

        <p>To re-iterate, the rule is that a <span class="index" xref="Words">Proficiency</span> must be unique enough that the Character may only make use of it in very specific circumstances. For example, it would be improper to take “Sneaky” on Thief, as it is far too general.</p>

        <p>Something like “Sneak Attack” may be more appropriate, as then it would only garner advantages in very specific circumstances. In fact, “one off” effects like combat maneuvers, tricks, or social resources work particularly well for Proficiencies.</p>

        <p>When a Player wishes to make use of a Character’s Proficiency, they must first declare it in their Pledge. When that happens, they can add +1 to the Character’s Performance and, if successful, an additional +1 to their Degree of Success. </p>

        <p>However, once that Proficiency is used, they may not use it again for – at the very least – the remainder of the scene. Some Proficiencies may have longer “cool-down” periods depending on the effect.</p>

        <h2>Taking 5</h2>

        <p>When a Character is not in a situation that is under duress, is unopposed, and has plenty of time to work at a task, their Player may opt to <span class="index" xref="Action">Take 5</span>. Effectively, in such a situation, a Character can resolve an Action with a Performance equal to their appropriate Word Levels + 5 without the need for a Throw. </p>

        <p>This, of course, eliminates the possibility of a Critical Throw, but at the same time eliminates the possibility of a Critical Failure. The Storyteller is the ultimate authority on when such a resolution is appropriate to attempt.</p>

        <h2>Taking Risks</h2>

        <p>When a Character is performing an Action and wishes to take a gamble, they may choose to take on some additional <span class="index" xref="Action">Risk</span>. For each Level of Risk a Player takes, the Character’s Performance is reduced by one, but their Degree of Success is increased by one, up to three Levels. Essentially this reduces the chance of Success, but increases the benefits of succeeding if one does. Generally speaking, Risk cannot be taken when a Character is more or less assured of Success (such as when the Difficulty is trivial, when Taking 5, etc.).</p>

        <h2>Collaborating</h2>

        <p>Sometimes, more than one Character needs to work together to complete a single Action. In these circumstances they can <span class="index" xref="Action">Collaborate</span>. </p>

        <p>When a Character decides to Collaborate with another, they must announce their intention before Throwing. If the acting Character accepts their help, the Collaborator may – as their Action – add one of their Words to the Pledge. </p>

        <p>The Storyteller is responsible for determining under which circumstances Collaboration would work and the reasonable maximum number of Collaborators permitted for each attempt.</p>

        <h2>Additional Targets</h2>

        <p>Sometimes a Character may want to take an Action which tries to affect more than one Target or have an increased Area of Effect than it normally would. Under these circumstances, the Character may divvy up their potential Degree of Success among multiple Targets or beyond the usual Area of Effect before Throwing against each <span class="index" xref="Action">Additional Target</span> affected.</p>

        <h2>Contested Actions</h2>

        <p>Sometimes an Action is directly opposed, or two Characters are trying to accomplish the same thing at the same time where only one can succeed (such as a race or grappling). In this case, a <span class="index">Contest</span> occurs. Both Characters Pledge appropriate Words and Throw simultaneously with the Storyteller. Whoever’s Performance is higher wins. If there is a tie, whoever’s Degree of Success is higher wins. If there is still a tie, neither wins.</p>

        <p>One variation of this is the <span class="index" xref="Contest">Delayed Contest</span>, where Characters match their skills at different times, the first establishing the Difficulty to overcome a task in the future. For example, a Character may forge a signature by Throwing their appropriate skills: Their Performance would determine the Difficulty for another Character, at a later time, to discover the ruse.</p>

        <h2>Plinth</h2>

        <p>When a Character is in a new situation and decides they wish to proceed without exerting themselves, the Storyteller may allow them to resolve an action by their <span class="index">Plinth</span>, or a Performance equal to the total Level of their appropriate Words without a Throw. If their Plinth it is over the normal Difficulty, they in essence receive an automatic success. </p>

        <p>Their Plinth cannot be used more than once for any situation, and further attempts must be Thrown.</p>

        <p>Common situations where resolving an Action by a Character’s Plinth may be a good idea include: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Picking up first-impression details of a new scene they come across.</li>
            <li>Doing everyday Actions as part of their routine.</li>
            <li>Any other effortless Action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Chapter 3: Manipulating Words</h1>

        <img src="/img/saint_ursula.png">

        <p>Words in Amalgam can be “manipulated” in a variety of ways to achieve a number of in-game effects.  In this chapter we’ll go over the rules concerning them.</p>

        <h2>Switching Words</h2>

        <p>The most rudimentary way of manipulating Words is determining which Words are Active and which are Autonomous. As such, <span class="index" xref="Words">Switching</span> allows you to swap Words in and out of your Active Amalgamate during the course of the story. </p>

        <p>Generally, a Player may switch one of their Character’s Words in before taking an Action. If a Player chooses to take no Action with their Character for that round, or takes an Action that involves waiting (such as aiming or setting themselves up to spring a trap) they may switch two Words rather than one.</p>

        <img src="/img/word_switch.png" class="max5in">

        <p>If the Character is not in a stressful situation, they may swap their Words however they wish. Free-swapping is especially useful while Taking 5 or in preparation for a conflict or quest.</p>

        <h2>Imposing Words</h2>

        <p>Whenever a Character tries to affect another Character (whether by persuasion, by diplomacy, sword and shield, etc.) they may attempt do so by <span class="index" xref="Words">Imposition</span>.   </p>

        <p>Imposition is the process by which a Character can temporarily alter the Words in another Character’s Amalgamate. For example, to quiet a frightened Character, they may impose the Word “Calm.” To sneak past a guard, they may try to impose the Word “Oblivious,” or to physically hurt another Character, they can try to impose the Word “Wounded.” </p>

        <p>Depending on the setting and genre of the game, the Storyteller and Players collectively may come up with conventions for various in-game effects.</p>

        <p>Let us say that our Thief Character wishes to fast-talk their way past security into a building. By taking an Action with a Difficulty of 5, the Thief may attempt to Impose the Word of their choice upon their opponent. An opening Pledge might be something like the following:</p>


        <blockquote>“With a <strong>Civil</strong> tone, I <strong>Guilefully</strong> express to him in a <strong>Persuasive</strong> manner that I left my identification in my office upstairs... He seems like a <strong>Compliant</strong> sort.”</blockquote>


        <p>In the above example, our Thief is Pledging Civil, Guileful, and Persuasive against the guard (a Pledge of 3) in an attempt to Impose the word Compliant, so that he may pass.</p>

        <p>Now, after the acting Character makes their initial Pledge for their Action, the defending Character may immediately Pledge any appropriate Active Words they have in their Amalgamate to increase the Difficulty by their combined Level. They may not, however, alter their current configuration beforehand by swapping any of their Words.</p>

        <p>So now, the guard (played by the Storyteller) may reply with the following Pledge:</p>


        <blockquote>“Being <strong>Stubborn</strong> by nature, I want to do this by the book. Let’s hear this story.”</blockquote>


        <p>The guard has Pledged Stubborn in his defense, making his Pledge equal to 1.</p>

        <p>Now our Thief will make their Throw at +3 (their total Pledge) against a Difficulty of 6 (an Average Task of 5 + the guard’s Pledge). A little tricky, but doable.</p>

        <p>If the acting Character succeeds, the defending Character must now deal with the Imposition. A number of their Active Words (equal to the Degree of Success – known as <span class="index" xref="Words">Influence</span>) are now Imposed. When a Word is Imposed, it is temporarily removed from the Character’s Amalgamate and replaced with another Word. If you’re using index cards to keep track of your Character’s Words, simply deal an appropriate Word card on top of the affected one – conventionally marked with (I).</p>

        <img src="/img/imposition.png" class="max5in">

        <p>If there are more than can fit in your Active Amalgamate, the remainder are dealt in Autonomous.</p>

        <p>The Words that were Pledged in defense are the first to be Imposed. Once those run out, the pool of choices opens up to include the Character’s Active Amalgamate, and in both cases it is the defending Player’s choice which Words are changed.</p>

        <p>In certain circumstances, a Player may opt not to Pledge any Words in Defense of an Imposition. For example, if another Character is trying to heal them, it would not be a very good idea to resist. Even in this situation, the Storyteller may counter-Pledge any Autonomous Words that might get in the way.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Level Words & Influence</h2>

        <p>When dealing with <span class="index" xref="Words">Influence</span>, Words of multiple Levels (i.e. Level 2 or higher) have a special advantage: They can resist more Influence before they are overcome.</p>

        <img src="/img/imposition_2.png" class="max5in">

        <p>For example, let’s say that the security guard’s Stubborn, from our previous example, was a Level 2. In this case, an Influence of 1 would not be not enough to alter a Level 2 Word. Instead, the Storyteller will have to note down how much Influence the guard’s Stubborn has been hit with (usually with dots or Xs). The next time someone tries to Impose upon that Word, the previous Influence will be taken into account as well. </p>

        <p>Multiple points of Influence can be absorbed in this way by multiple Words at a time. For example, if a Character has two Level 2 Words Pledged in defense, and is hit with 2 points of Influence, they may opt for each of their Level 2 Words to absorb one point each, allowing the Character to continue unscathed.</p>

        <p>Now, the “banked” Influence accumulated will eventually go away as would be appropriate. Under normal circumstances, this means that they should go away when the Character has adequate time to rest and recover or is otherwise removed from the relevant context. If the Character is continually subjected to stress (no sleep, torture, etc.), the Influence will not go away.</p>

        <p>One last and very important thing to remember is if the defending Character did not Pledge any Words in defense then, when absorbing Influence, all of their Words are treated as if they are Level 1 (i.e. 1 point of Influence causes them to change). They have been simply caught off guard.</p>

        <h2>Restoring Words</h2>

        <p>One can <span class="index" xref="Words">Restore</span> Words back to their previous state either over time or through in-game efforts. </p>

        <p>Generally, all Imposed Words are returned to their previous forms at the beginning of an adventure, after a good night’s sleep, or at any point where the Characters have had enough time to properly recover (in similar manner to Influence). </p>

        <p>For Characters who wish to be more proactive in Restoring their Words, they can be brought back to their previous state by succeeding in actions where the Imposed Words would have been used. In a sense, by succeeding without their help they are able to restore their confidence in their own abilities.</p>

        <p>Characters may also opt to try and Restore Words through healing or meditative abilities – essentially Imposing the prior Words back to their proper places. The Difficulty for such an action is equal to 5 + the total Level of Imposed Words. The Degree of Success is then deducted from the Influence of whichever Words are appropriate. Once all Influence on a Word is removed, the Word is restored, and equal levels of its Imposed counterpart is removed from the Character’s Amalgamate.</p>

        <h2>Exhausting Words</h2>

        <p>When your Character is attempting to perform an Action that is exceedingly difficult or wishes to put everything they have into the result, their Player may choose to <span class="index" xref="Words">Exhaust</span> one or more of their Active Words.</p>

        <img src="/img/exhausted.png" class="max5in">

        <p>Each Word they choose to Exhaust, must be declared before the Action is resolved with a Throw, and may be counted as double its Level. As a result, however, at the end of the Action it is immediately Imposed by the word “Exhausted.”</p>

        <p>All Exhausteds that are acquired in this way cannot be Restored without appropriate in-game actions, such as an uninterrupted rest or non-trivial healing efforts. If a Character Exhausts all of their Active Words at once, at the end of their Action they become Incapacitated.</p>

        <p>One cannot Exhaust Words when they Take 5 or use their Plinth. However, they may use a Proficiency in the same Throw, but cannot regain their Proficiency until after the Exhausted word is Restored.</p>

        <h2>Incapacitation &amp; Destroying Words</h2>

        <p>If a Character has all of their Active Words Imposed upon, they become <span class="index">Incapacitated</span>. If it is from physical Imposition, they’ve been knocked down. If it’s from mental Imposition, they are stunned. For all intents and purposes, they are unable to act until they are able to Switch in at least 3 fresh, unhindered Words, either one at a time or have them Restored by another Character.</p>

        <img src="/img/exhausted_2.png" class="max5in">

        <p>Additionally, once a Character has no more Active Words to Impose upon, further Imposition can <span class="index" xref="Words">Destroy</span> them. Strength is shattered. Beauty is ruined. Willpower is cut to ribbons. In short, they are removed from the Character’s Amalgamate and can only be gained back through the awarding of Experience.</p>

        <p>Losing a Word is a jarring event, and should be roleplayed accordingly. For example, if a Character were to lose the word “Calm,” it would be appropriate for them to become suddenly panicked. If they were to lose the word “Strong,” the in-game effect may be that they have broken a bone.</p>

        <p>Words that are Destroyed leave their Active slots empty, and must have other Words Switched in to take their place.</p>

        <p>When all of one’s Active Words are Destroyed – i.e. all Active slots have been emptied in this manner, no matter how many Inactive Words they may still have left – they expire as a Playable Character. If it is from physical wounds, they die. If it is from emotional damage, they go insane, etc. The Character is now the Storyteller’s responsibility and the Player must start afresh.</p>

        <h2>Action Rounds & Combat</h2>

        <p>Sometimes when flurries of Impositions go back and forth, especially during <span class="index">Combat</span>, the flow of play needs to become more organized to facilitate it. <span class="index" xref="Action">Action Rounds</span> are quick and clean(er) way in Amalgam to solve this problem.</p>

        <p>First, each Player must Pledge what their Character intends to do, describing their actions along with their Words that fit. This can be a good time for the Players to collaborate and coordinate with each other.</p>

        <p>If Weapons or Armor are involved, read up on the chapter on Items to understand how they work. Aggressive Actions are carried out by Imposing appropriate Words. </p>

        <p>For example, for physical combat “Wounded,” “Broken,” “Bleeding,” etc. For mental combat “Confused,” “Dazed,” “Complacent,” “Panicked,” etc.. Overall, the Words you Impose upon opponents should always serve a purpose, from Imposing “Ignorant” upon them to sneak by or by Imposing “Wounded” upon them to bring them down.</p>

        <p>Second, the Storyteller assigns Difficulty modifiers to each player based upon the quality of their descriptions and tactical considerations. “Called shots” like trying to Impose Blindness may take on modifiers or require levels of Risk depending on the situation. If there are a lot of Characters to keep track of, these can be represented by putting tokens down on the table, or handing over index cards.</p>

        <p>Third, everyone Throws at the same time against the Storyteller to determine their Performances and potential Degrees of Success.</p>

        <p>Fourth, the Characters then act in the order of their Performances, the Storyteller detailing their Successes and Failures.</p>

        <p>Finally, when all else is settled, start a new round until there is no need to keep up rounds.</p>

        <h2>Special Attacks & Maneuvers</h2>

        <p>Through the use of Exhausting Words and Proficiencies, one can represent a wide range of <span class="index" xref="Action">Special Attacks</span>, <span class="index" xref="Action">Maneuvers</span>, or other Actions during Combat; however, there are a few Actions that follow some additional rules:</p>

        <h2>Aiming or Powering Up</h2>

        <p>If a Character chooses to <span class="index" xref="Action">Aim</span> or <span class="index" xref="Action">Power Up</span> as their Action during Combat, they may Switch two Words that Round instead of one.</p>

        <h2>Defending</h2>

        <p>Instead of Attacking, a Character may choose to <span class="index" xref="Action">Defend</span> or <span class="index" xref="Action">Dodge</span> in a particular Round. This allows them to Pledge Words that they would normally use for Attacking as well as their Weapons in Defense.</p>

        <p>In some circumstances, Characters with appropriate Words can also Collaborate Defense, such as creating a distraction, interference, or cover fire with bullets, arrows, or magic while their comrade attempts another Action, or is hunkering down to Defend, themselves. In this case, the Collaborator chooses to Defend their target comrade, and may Pledge an appropriate Word in their Active Amalgamate in their comrade’s Defense.</p>

        <h2>Multiple Targets or Attacks</h2>

        <p>A Character may use the <span class="index" xref="Action">Additional Targets</span> rules to effectively attack or affect additional Characters per round, provided that the situation allows for it.</p>

        <h2>Grappling</h2>

        <p>When one Character tries to <span class="index" xref="Action">Grapple</span> and incapacitate another by force, it is treated as a Contested Action whose goal is to impose “Grappled” upon the target. </p>

        <p>However, if the Character who’s attempting the Grapple fails, the receiving Character may treat their successful Contested Action as an Attack instead (essentially, an attack of opportunity, either to Wound or to Grapple back).</p>

        <p>Once successfully Grappled, a Character may only act to try and break the Grapple with further Contested Actions to Impose Words of “Grappled” upon their opponent. </p>

        <p>At any time, whichever Character has fewer “Grappled” words Imposed is the one who is presently in control. Whoever is in control of a Grapple may choose to release it at any time. When that happens, all Imposed “Grapples” can be Recovered (usually at the rate of one per Round).</p>

        <p>As per normal rules, if all of a Character’s Active Words are “Grappled” they are completely incapacitated and may not act until they otherwise could.</p>

        <p>Finally, there can only be one Grapple between two parties per Round. Any additional participants must follow the Collaboration rules, adding Words to their “side.” </p>

        <h1>Chapter 4: Items</h1>

        <img src="/img/weapons.png">

        <p><span class="index">Items</span> are treated as Words which range from Levels 1 to 5. In order to use an Item, you must either: </p>

        <p>1) Switch it in as Active Word, essentially using one of your Active slots to accommodate it.</p>

        <img src="/img/item_case_1.png" class="max5in">

        <p style="text-align:center"><em>Case 1: An item as an Active Word.</em></p>

        <p>Or 2) if you have a Word appropriate for its use (say Gunslinger for a firearm), you may Stack it in on top of that Word, which effectively adds to that Word’s Level. (Only one item may be stacked upon a Word at a time.)</p>

        <p>If an Item which is Switched in Actively is Imposed (case 1), it has somehow been dropped, disabled, jammed, or otherwise needs repairs before it can work properly again.</p>

        <p>If it’s an Item that is Stacked (case 2) and the word it’s on is Imposed, it will need to be Switched to another Word or Switched in Actively before it can be used again.</p>
        
        <img src="/img/item_case_2.png" class="max5in">

        <p style="text-align:center"><em>Case 2: An item Stacked.</em></p>

        <h2>Item Level</h2>

        <p>Item Level is generally determined by how powerful or well-suited to a particular purpose it is. It is best to make common, “mundane” items Level 1. For example, Items which you could not accomplish a task easily without, such as a screwdriver, a can opener, a key, should all be Level 1. Extra-strength items should be Level 2, and fine-quality Items should be Level 3. Level 4 items are harder to find and usually denote exceptional crafting where Level 5 should be reserved for unique, rare, or devastating items.</p>

        <h2>Weapons</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Items">Weapons</span> generally, excusing the pun, give you an edge in combat by increasing the number of appropriate Word Levels in your Amalgamate and your Degree of Success.</p>

        <p>Weapons can also be Exhausted to a number of effects. For example, Exhausting a Gun might have the effect of unloading the entire clip. Exhausting a Sword may have the effect of a special maneuver, or that it has been thrown. Depending on how the Exhaustion is played, Exhausted weapons are either discarded, or need to somehow be re-set before being used again.</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the previous Chapter, in some circumstances like Defending, most Weapons can be Pledged in defense, whether using a Sword to block, or a Gun to create cover fire.</p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Example Weapons:</figcaption>
            <dl>
                <dt>Level 1:  </dt>
                <dd>Knives, Slingshots, Small Projectiles</dd>
                <dt>Level 2:  </dt>

                <dd>Fine Blades, Longbow, Longarms</dd>
                <dt>Level 4:  </dt>
                <dd>Assault Rifles, Hollow Points, Magic Axes</dd>
                <dt>Level 5:  </dt>
                <dd>Legendary Blades, Explosives</dd>
            </dl>
        </figure>


        <h2>Armor</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Items">Armor</span>, once Active may be Pledged in defense of whomever is trying to harm you. For example, if our Thief has a Flak Jacket L2, any other Character attempting to attack them would have a -2 penalty on their Throw. Armor can absorb Influence and be Imposed like any other Word. </p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>Example Armor:</figcaption>
            <dl>
                <dt>Level 1:  </dt>
                <dd>Hardened Leather, Kendo Bogu</dd>
                <dt>Level 2:  </dt>
                <dd>Chainmail, Flak Jacket</dd>
                <dt>Level 3:  </dt>
                <dd>Full Kevlar, Steel Breastplate and Greaves</dd>
                <dt>Level 4:  </dt>
                <dd>Full Steel Armor, Bomb Squad Armor</dd>
                <dt>Level 5:  </dt>
                <dd>Force Fields, Magic Armor</dd>
            </dl>
        </figure>

        <p>Additionally, to determine a reasonable Level for a piece of Armor, the Storyteller should take the total area that it covers, along with its quality into account. For example, it would be foolish to give something a small as a Codpiece (regardless of how… confident a Character is about themselves) any more than one Level.</p>

        <p>Finally, different types of Armor are not appropriate in different situations. Something made of Kevlar will stop a bullet, but a knife would cut through it with little trouble. It is up to the Players and the Storyteller to keep these situations in mind, and is not something that is worth a chart to outline in this book. Brains and common sense should take precedence over manipulating the rules to undue advantage.</p>

        <h2>Consumable Items</h2>

        <p>Items that are <span class="index" xref="Items">Consumable</span>, such as food, potions, special ammunition, and raw materials may be Exhausted as part of a Throw, after which they are discarded (i.e. Consumed).</p>

        <h2>Crafting</h2>

        <p>When a Character wants to create an Item, they need to first gather whatever materials are necessary, and the Storyteller needs to determine a Difficulty for <span class="index" xref="Items">Crafting</span>. Crafting consists of making Crafting Throws against that Difficulty, and “building up” the Degree of Success into a new Word.</p>

        <p>For example, let’s say a blacksmith wants to make a L1 Knife. The Storyteller determines that it is an average task with a Difficulty of 5. A simple success with at least a Degree of 1 would be enough to create it.</p>

        <img src="/img/crafting.png" class="max5in">

        <p style="text-align:center"><em>Cumulative Degrees of Success needed by Level.</em></p>

        <p>If that same blacksmith wants to make a L3 Fine Blade, the Storyteller would be more likely to decide that it’s a skilled task with a Difficulty of 7 or 8. Since a normal level 3 Word is made up of  9 individual Words, the blacksmith would have to “bank” 9 Degrees of Success over the course of as many Throws as necessary. Crafting Throws can only be made once over a regular unit of time, so our blacksmith may need to make a Crafting Throw once a day over the course of several days to accumulate 9 Degrees of Success total in order to make that Fine Blade.</p>

        <p>While Crafting, a Character may not Take 5, since Crafting is an active task. A Critical Throw doubles that attempt’s Degree of Success, where a Critical Failure ruins the piece. The Storyteller may opt to bestow special properties to the Item if multiple Critical Throws happen, or if there is a Critical Throw on the final Throw.</p>

        <p>Repairs or alterations can be made in a similar manner, and rare raw material Items used may be Consumed to help the progress along (i.e. they become part of the new Item).</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5: Thaumaturgy</h1>

        <p><span class="index">Thaumaturgy</span> (or “wonder-working”) is a way that a Character can influence the world around them beyond normal physical means, whether by Magic, Super Powers, or other fantastical means. As such, choosing appropriate Words are very dependent upon the setting of the game. For the sake of consistency, a Storyteller may opt for a particular set of Words or “Schools” of Thaumaturgy to choose from by pre-grouping them into Stacks.</p>

        <p>A number of common Words one can employ include the following, and where this is a discrete list, many of these can overlap, can be extended, and the mechanics of one category can readily be used in or adopted by other categories. In many cases, they may even be used together to combine into completely new effects.</p>

        <h2>Healing</h2>

        <p>The main focus of <span class="index">Healing</span> Words are to cure Wounds, treat Disease, reverse Poisons, and essentially Restore Words back to their original state. This can be done with an Action with the Difficulty equal to 5 + the combined Levels of Influence a Character is under (regardless of its source) and when successful, it removes an amount of Influence equal to the Degree of Success.</p>

        <p>Common Healing Words include: <strong>Healer, Medic, Shaman,</strong> etc.</p>

        <h2>Affecting</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Affecting</span> is the ability to grant temporary Words that (similar to Items) stack on top of Words they target, increasing their effective Level. Unlike Items, they cannot be moved, and stay with the Words they’re played on. </p>

        <p>These temporary Words are called <span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Effects</span>, and last for the duration of a scene, or until they are Imposed upon. When that happens, they are discarded.</p>

        <p>Granting beneficial Effects (like Blessing, Buff, Protection, etc.) can be done with an Action with the Difficulty equal to 5 + the combined Levels of Effects a Character has (regardless of their source) and when successful, it grants an Effect equal to the Degree of Success.</p>

        <p>Adverse Effects (such as Curse or Enfeeble) work in the opposite direction, reducing a Word’s effective Level, except that a Character may Pledge appropriate Words in their Defense of the Throw.</p>

        <p>Common Affectation Words include: <strong>Inspiration, Blessing, Protection, Barrier, Curse, Feeblemind, Weakness,</strong> etc.</p>

        <h2>Summoning</h2>

        <p>Conjuring creatures or objects to one’s aid can come in handy in a pinch. One can use <span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Summoning</span> words to persuade local fauna to help you or cause objects to fly to your command.</p>

        <p><strong>With Objects</strong> – If the target is an inanimate object that is nearby with which you have some kind of connection (it’s your personal sword, for example) a simple Throw against its Level will Summon it to your hand. The Difficulty increases with distance – both physical distance, as well as in its relation to the Character, personally.</p>

        <p><strong>With Animals & Creatures</strong> – If the target is a Familiar or other creature with some sentience with whom you have a connection within the immediate vicinity, you can simply call out to them. If you wish to use some kind of mental link, or if the target is unconnected to you, but would be in the general vicinity, the Difficulty is equal to the number of Word Levels in their Amalgamate. (See the Brief Bestiary in the chapter on Storytelling for example creatures and their Word Levels.)</p>

        <p>Once the target arrives, if it is not inclined to help you or follow your commands, you can Impose appropriate persuasion-related Words.</p>

        <p>Summoning high Level creatures (like angels, demons, or elementals) can be difficult for a single Character, and may require Collaboration with others or appropriate Items.</p>

        <p>Sometimes two characters will try and summon the same object or animal. In these cases, it can be resolved with a Grapple.</p>

        <h2>Transmutation</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Transmutation</span> is about transforming one thing into another. In its most simple form one can simply Impose appropriate Words upon something for a temporary change, and use Crafting rules (upon objects or the Words of other Characters) to make more permanent changes.</p>

        <h2>Divination</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Divination</span> is the ability to gain information by other than conventional means, whether seeing the future, tracking or remote perception, or even asking questions of the divine.</p>

        <p>Generally these actions have high Difficulties and the use of Items helps surmount them (a piece of clothing of the person you’re looking for, for example), which are often – but not always – Consumed.</p>

        <h2>Mentalism &amp; Illusion</h2>

        <p><span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Mentalism</span> Words are all about tricking the senses, causing hallucinations, seeing things that aren’t there, or to ignore things that are. These sorts of effects are created by a Delayed Contest, whereby the Performance establishes the Difficulty to detect the Illusion, and the  Degree of Success necessary to dispel it. Modifiers can be added for how involved or interactive the Illusion is.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, one can also try to cause a target to sleep, follow suggestions, or change their minds, in which case requires a direct Contest or Grapple – depending on the occasion.</p>

        <h2>Polymancy</h2>

        <p>These Words (conventionally ending with the suffix -mancy which means “control”) are about bending raw forces of energy or different archetypes to one’s will, and are a good way to articulate different domains of powers.</p>

        <p>A Character may potentially use <span class="index" xref="Thaumaturgy">Polymancy</span> Words for an Attack, an Affect, potentially Summon appropriate entities (elementals, golems, zombies, etc.), or as any other Thaumaturgical Word could be used.</p>

        <p>Common Polymancy Words include: <strong>Aeromancy</strong> (for air), <strong>Pyromancy</strong> (for fire), <strong>Terramancy</strong> (for earth), <strong>Aquamancy</strong> (for water), <strong>Technomancy</strong> (for technology), <strong>Necromancy</strong> (for death),  <strong>Arithmancy</strong> (for numbers, as an alternate to Divination), <strong>Bibliomancy</strong> (for books or knowledge), etc.</p>
